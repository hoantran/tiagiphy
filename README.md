# TiaGiphy

This is a Giphy client on iOS. It has two columns, displaying random GIFs from from Giphy's [REST API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/#operation--gifs-random-get).

It first loads a fixed number of GIFs in the beginning. Once scrolled down to the bottom, it loads a few more.
Modify settings in the Constants file to change some of the app's behaviors.
